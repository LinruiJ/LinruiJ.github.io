It is glad to announce that I graduate from UESTC with B.Eng. Merit Degree in Electronic Science and Technology. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to my advisor [Prof. Jun Zhou](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=kWeqfrMAAAAJ&hl=en) for the invaluable research experience. I also want to express my thanks to all the teachers who generously answered my questions. Lastly, I am deeply appreciative of the unwavering support from my parents, grandparents, and friends.
